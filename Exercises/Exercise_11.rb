#I find the official Ruby docs at https://ruby-doc.org/ is a fantastic tool. 
#The layout is intuitive and even without guidance it is easy to learn and navigate
#the documents. As for rails, I have spent some time browsing the docs at
#https://api.rubyonrails.org/. I plan on dipping my feet into their rails guide very
#soon.
